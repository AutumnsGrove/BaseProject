## ðŸ”„ Remaining Tasks (6 files)

Use **Task tool with subagents** for each remaining file to minimize context usage.

### 1. uv_usage.md (779 â†’ ~350 lines)

**Launch subagent:**
```

## Final Tasks

### 7. Update README.md

**Launch subagent:**
```
Task tool:
- subagent_type: "quick-code-patch"
- description: "Update README.md with new files"
- prompt: "Update /Users/mini/Documents/Projects/BaseProject/ClaudeUsage/README.md to include new files:

Add to appropriate sections:
- secrets_advanced.md (under Core Workflows or new 'Advanced Topics' section)
- git_conventional_commits.md (under Core Workflows)

Ensure all cross-references are accurate and the table of contents reflects the new structure."
```

---

## Why Use Subagents?

**Benefits:**
1. **Reduced Context**: Each subagent works on one file only (~800-1000 tokens vs. 5000+)
2. **Parallel Work**: Can process multiple files if needed
3. **Focused Changes**: Each agent has clear, specific instructions
4. **Clean History**: Each refactoring gets its own commit
5. **Easy Recovery**: If one fails, others aren't affected

---

## Execution Strategy

### Sequential Approach (Recommended)
```bash
# For each remaining file:
1. Launch subagent with Task tool
2. Wait for completion
3. Verify line count: wc -l filename
4. Test that content is still useful
5. Move to next file
```

### Parallel Approach (Advanced)
```bash
# Launch multiple subagents at once:
# Use single message with multiple Task tool calls
# Claude will process them in parallel
# Collect results when all complete
```

---

## Verification Checklist

After each subagent completes:

- [ ] Line count meets target (Â±20 lines acceptable)
- [ ] Quick start section intact
- [ ] Core functionality preserved
- [ ] Cross-references updated
- [ ] No broken internal links
- [ ] File still useful for new users
- [ ] File still useful for Claude Code assistant

---

## Success Criteria

**Overall Project Goals:**
- âœ… All files under 600 lines
- âœ… Most files 200-400 lines
- âœ… Beginner vs advanced content separated
- âœ… Better cross-referencing
- âœ… Reduced token usage
- âœ… Maintained usefulness

**Expected Final State:**
- Total documentation: ~6,925 â†’ ~3,500 lines (49% reduction)
- Better organized and scannable
- Faster for assistants to find information
- Less overwhelming for new users

## Resume Command

To resume this work:

1. Read this file: `next_task.md`
2. Check current todo list (if still active)
3. Start with task #1 (uv_usage.md)
4. Use Task tool with prompt from above
5. Proceed sequentially through remaining tasks
