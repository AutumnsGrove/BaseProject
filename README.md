# BaseProject - Claude Code Template

A comprehensive project template with built-in Claude Code workflows, best practices, and extensive documentation for rapid development setup.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: New Project Setup

**One-liner in Claude Code:**
```
Clone https://github.com/AutumnsGrove/BaseProject (master branch) to /tmp, copy to ~/Projects/[ASK ME PROJECT NAME] excluding (.git/), rename TEMPLATE_CLAUDE.md to CLAUDE.md, customize CLAUDE.md sections (Project Purpose, Tech Stack, API Keys List, Architecture Notes) and README.md (title, description, features) with my project details [ASK ME: name, description, tech stack, API keys needed], init language-specific dependencies (uv for Python, npm for JS, go mod for Go), create proper directory structure (src/ with __init__.py or index.js, tests/ with __init__.py), generate secrets_template.json with my API key placeholders, write TODOS.md with 3-5 initial tasks derived from project description, git init with user.name and user.email from global git config, optionally copy pre-commit hooks from ClaudeUsage/pre_commit_hooks/ [ASK ME], make initial commit "feat: initialize [PROJECT] from BaseProject template", display project summary and next steps
```

Claude will interactively:
- Ask for project name, tech stack, and requirements
- Copy BaseProject template to your chosen location
- Customize CLAUDE.md with your project details
- Set up language-specific dependencies (pyproject.toml, package.json, etc.)
- Create proper project structure (src/, tests/)
- Generate secrets_template.json with your needed API keys
- Initialize git with proper configuration
- Create initial commit following our standards

---

### Option 2: Add to Existing Project

**For projects already in progress with existing code, documentation, and git history:**

```
Clone https://github.com/AutumnsGrove/BaseProject (master branch) to /tmp/bp, analyze my project: read existing README.md/CLAUDE.md, scan git history for commit patterns, detect tech stack and package managers, identify project architecture (monorepo/single package/etc), read TODOS.md if exists, copy ClaudeUsage/ to my project (preserve any existing ClaudeUsage/ files, only add new guides), intelligently merge CLAUDE.md: if exists parse sections and merge BaseProject sections using markers like "<!-- BaseProject: Git Workflow -->", if new create from template with detected project details, enhance .gitignore by merging entries (preserve existing, add missing), analyze commit messages and suggest adopting BaseProject style if inconsistent, check if using branches like dev/main and suggest workflow if not, optionally setup pre-commit hooks [ASK ME], generate/update TODOS.md with project-aware tasks, create integration-summary.md report showing what was added/merged/skipped, backup modified files to ./.baseproject-backup-[TIMESTAMP]/, cleanup temp directory, display next steps
```

Claude will intelligently:
- Analyze your existing project structure and conventions
- Detect tech stack from package files (package.json, pyproject.toml, etc.)
- Copy ClaudeUsage/ guides without overwriting existing files
- Merge CLAUDE.md sections with clear markers (preserves your content)
- Append missing .gitignore entries without removing existing ones
- Compare your commit style to BaseProject standards and offer suggestions
- Create backup of all modified files before making changes
- Generate integration-summary.md showing exactly what was changed
- Respect your existing README.md (won't overwrite)
- Adapt to your project's existing structure

### Manual Setup

For full control over the setup process, see [NEW_PROJECT_SETUP.md](https://github.com/AutumnsGrove/BaseProject/blob/dev/TemplateDocs/NEW_PROJECT_SETUP.md) in the dev branch for detailed step-by-step instructions.

## 🏠 House Agents Integration

This template works seamlessly with [house-agents](https://github.com/houseworthe/house-agents) - specialized Claude Code sub-agents that keep your context clean.

### What Are House Agents?

Specialized sub-agents that run heavy operations in separate context windows:
- **house-research** - Search 70k+ tokens across files, return 3k summary (95% savings)
- **house-git** - Analyze 43k token diffs, return 500 token summary (98% savings)
- **house-bash** - Process 21k+ command output, return 700 token summary (97% savings)

### Quick Install

**Project-Level (this project only):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/houseworthe/house-agents.git /tmp/house-agents
cp -r /tmp/house-agents/.claude .
```

**User-Wide (all projects):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/houseworthe/house-agents.git /tmp/house-agents
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
cp /tmp/house-agents/.claude/agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/
```

**Test Installation:**
```
Use house-research to find all TODO comments in the codebase
```

See [ClaudeUsage/house_agents.md](ClaudeUsage/house_agents.md) for usage patterns and examples.

## 🛠️ Customization Workflow

After running setup:

1. **Edit CLAUDE.md** - Fill in your project specifics
   - Project purpose
   - Tech stack
   - Architecture notes

2. **Create secrets files** (if needed)
   ```bash
   # For Python projects
   cp ClaudeUsage/templates/secrets_template.json secrets_template.json
   cp secrets_template.json secrets.json
   # Edit secrets.json with real API keys
   ```

3. **Set up dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Python with UV
   uv init

   # JavaScript/Node
   npm init -y

   # Go
   go mod init yourproject
   ```

4. **Configure pre-commit hooks** (optional)
   ```bash
   cd ClaudeUsage/pre_commit_hooks/
   chmod +x pre-commit commit-msg
   cp pre-commit commit-msg ../../.git/hooks/
   ```

5. **Update TODOS.md** - Add your specific tasks

---

## 💡 Key Workflows

### Starting a New Feature
1. Check `TODOS.md` for pending tasks
2. Use Context7 to fetch relevant library docs
3. Follow git workflow for commits
4. Update TODOS.md as you progress

### Managing Secrets
1. Read `ClaudeUsage/secrets_management.md`
2. Create `secrets.json` (gitignored)
3. Provide `secrets_template.json` for team
4. Use environment variable fallbacks

### Large Codebase Search
1. Use house-research agent for 20+ file searches
2. Check `ClaudeUsage/house_agents.md` for patterns
3. Use subagents for complex multi-step tasks

### Writing Tests
1. Review `ClaudeUsage/testing_strategies.md`
2. Follow framework-specific patterns
3. Use test-strategist agent for planning

---

## 🔐 Security Defaults

This template includes security best practices by default:

- ✅ `secrets.json` in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks to prevent secret commits
- ✅ Environment variable fallback patterns
- ✅ Security audit guides in `secrets_advanced.md`

## 🤝 Working with Claude Code

This template is optimized for Claude Code CLI. Key features:

- **CLAUDE.md** triggers automatic context loading
- **Structured guides** for quick reference without token bloat
- **Subagent workflows** for complex tasks
- **Git commit standards** with auto-formatting

### Example Session
```bash
cd ~/Projects/MyNewProject/

# Claude automatically reads CLAUDE.md and knows your project context
claude "Add user authentication with JWT tokens"

# Claude will:
# 1. Check TODOS.md
# 2. Use Context7 to fetch JWT library docs
# 3. Implement following your git commit standards
# 4. Update TODOS.md
# 5. Commit with proper message format
```

## 📖 Learning Path

Recommended reading order for new projects:

1. [project_structure.md](ClaudeUsage/project_structure.md) - Directory layouts
2. [git_workflow.md](ClaudeUsage/git_workflow.md) - Version control
3. [secrets_management.md](ClaudeUsage/secrets_management.md) - API keys
4. [uv_usage.md](ClaudeUsage/uv_usage.md) - Python dependencies (if applicable)
